# Gradious-2-1 🚀  
*Learning • Experimenting • Growing*

## 🎯 About  
Welcome to **Gradious-2-1**, a personal sandbox of programming experiments and learning projects created by **Eshwar0709**.  
This repository serves as a collection of recorded programs, code snippets, and explorations in **Java (and possibly beyond)** — all aimed at sharpening my skills and documenting the journey.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure  
Here’s what you’ll find inside:

```
/
├── [Project1] – <brief description of Project1>
├── [Project2] – <brief description of Project2>
└── README.md – this file
```

> 💡 *Tip:* Each sub-folder in the repo corresponds to a standalone project or code exercise. Try running them in your favourite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) and explore how they are structured.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn (and What I’m Learning)  
- Core Java fundamentals — classes, objects, control flows, collections  
- Problem-solving exercises and algorithmic thinking  
- Code clarity: clean structure, meaningful naming, comments  
- Version control: tracking evolution, committing early and often  
- And more as I expand into new topics…

## ✅ Getting Started  
1. Clone or fork this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eshwar0709/Gradious-2-1.git
   ```  
2. Open the project in your IDE of choice.  
3. Navigate to one of the project folders, review the code, and run `main()` (or its equivalent).  
4. Tinker, debug, modify — make it yours!

## 📌 Why “Gradious-2-1”?  
The name symbolises a stepping-stone: *“Gradious”* suggests growth and advancement, *“2-1”* marks versioning — a nod to early-stage development and continuous improvement. Over time this repo will evolve into “Gradious-2-2”, “Gradious-3-0”, etc. 😉
